# Leaflet (Earthquake Map) challenge
In this project, I was tasked with building an interactive dashboard using Leaflet library to visualize earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). My job was to create a map that plots all the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. 



# Technical Skills

- Add popups with additional information about earthquakes when markers are clicked
- Create a legend to provide context for the map data
- Deploy the final project on a web hosting service like GitHub Pages
